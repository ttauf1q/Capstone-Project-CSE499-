This project was done to showcase my final capstone project during my last semester at North South University studying Computer Science and Engineering. Riddle Me is an Ai bot that can solve any kind of riddles and puzzles (Logical puzzles, Riddles, Mathematical puzzles and Word-based puzzles) we throw at it which helps us evaluate the problem-solving abilities of five different LLMs we worked with (Gemini, Cohere, Llama2.7, Llama3 and Llama 3.2 instruct) using prompts and without prompts. After successfully getting results we compare them by their accuracy, completion rate, response time, response quality, creativity and errors. Our results show that the models perform significantly better with prompts, achieving higher accuracy, faster response times, and more creative solutions compared to working without prompts. The aim of our project is to evaluate the problem-solving capabilities of different LLM models using brain teasers and complex riddles which needs humanlike humor and thinking to solve.
